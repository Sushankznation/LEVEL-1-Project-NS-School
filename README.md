some main classes I used in my projects are:
":hover" pseudo class--->
The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device,
but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers
over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).(I used this for Title and roatating the card).
"Button--->
The <button> tag defines a clickable button.

Inside a <button> element you can put text (and tags like <i>, <b>, <strong>, <br>, <img>, etc.).
  That is not possible with a button created with the <input> element !
  ------------------------------------------------------
 I tried to make it as much creatuve I can create this.
I Experiment with a lot of new tools in it.
  will improve in future
Hope you Like it.
